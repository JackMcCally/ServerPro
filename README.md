# Read Now
This plugin has only 5 commands as of now, but I only started on this yesterday. 
You should be checking everyday for updates as I will be pushing new updates daily.

# Installation
Download Link: https://www.mediafire.com/?yuwp3p8pplfy1n0

1. Download the .jar file. 
2. Place the file in your plugins folder.

# Usage
The most basic command is /help.
You will also notice that the chat has changed a bit. 
This can be overriden by different plugins. In the next update there will be a syntax.

There is a config.yml file. To edit settings simply open it up and you can do the following.

1. Set an MOTD (When someone joins it sends them a message)
2. Enable/Disable Drops 
3. Enable/Disable Fishing 
4. Enable/Disable Sprinting 
5. Enable/Disable Elimination Mode 

# Elimination Mode
In this mode, when players die they cannot respawn and will become spectators.
Enable/Disable this in config.yml
